# Paychex-PDF-Extractor
The PDF Extractor is a program intended to extract the data from a pdf receipt, parse the extracted data for the desired fields 
and enter that data into a database.  This project is based on one requested by employees at Paychex who were looking for a way 
to quickly and easily track their travel expenses, specifically hotels.

## Prerequisites
Apache Couchdb 3.0 installed and running locally  
Click [here](https://couchdb.apache.org/) to download and install

## Installation
(Currently what works)
* Download Zip file from main page
